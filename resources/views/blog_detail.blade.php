				<p class="blogpara">
					<strong>Lack of care: </strong> Most of us take our feet for granted. We often wear shoes that don’t fit us or we often forget to moisturize our feet. Since our feet are our least priority, we usually look for cheap soaps to clean them up. All these careless mistakes often lead to cracked heels.
				</p>

					<strong>Aging: </strong> With time our skin goes through various changes and if not taken care of, the chances of it getting damaged as we old become quite apparent. Aging can lead to dry skin patches around the body, including your feet. This, again, is not great for the health of your heels.
